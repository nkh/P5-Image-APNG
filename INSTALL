INSTALLATION IN A LOCAL DIRECTORY

If you don't have permission to install in the system Perl directories:

    perl Build.PL --install_base ~/perl5
    ./Build
    ./Build test

    export PATH=~/perl5/bin:$PATH

MANUAL DEPENDENCIES INSTALLATION

If automatic dependency resolution fails, install dependencies manually:

    cpan Module::Build
    cpan Image::Magick
    cpan Test::More

TROUBLESHOOTING

If tests fail:
    - Ensure Image::Magick is properly installed
    - Check that you have write permissions in /tmp
    - Try running tests with verbose output:
        ./Build test verbose=1

If installation fails:
    - Check that you have write permissions to Perl library directories
    - Try installing to a local directory (see above)
    - Ensure all dependencies are installed

For Image::Magick installation issues:
    - Ensure ImageMagick C library is installed first
    - Check ImageMagick version compatibility
    - See: https://imagemagick.org/script/perl-magick.php
